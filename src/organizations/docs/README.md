# Overview

Organizations group users together in the app. This can be useful for a number

  members on projects. You can share projects with your organization, and all
  members of the organization will have access to the project.
- **Permissions**: You can set permissions for your organization, which will
  apply to all projects shared with the organization. This allows you to control
  who can view, edit, and delete projects.

  you to pay for all projects shared with the organization. This can be useful
  if you have multiple team members working on projects together.

There are three permission levels:
- **Owner**: The owner has full control over the organization. They can add and
  remove members, change settings, and delete the organization.
- **Admin**: The admin has almost full control over the organization. They can
  add and remove members, change settings, and create projects. They cannot
  delete the organization.
- **Member**: The member has limited control over the organization. They can
  view and edit projects shared with the organization. They cannot add or remove
  members, change settings, or delete the organization.
